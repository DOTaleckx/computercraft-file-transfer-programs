# computercraft-file-transfer-programs
A file transfer system I made for ComputerCraft using Rednet / ComputerCraft modems.

<b>REQUIREMENTS</b>
- ComputerCraft (CC:Tweaked)
- At least 2 computers connected via modems or wireless modems
- IDs for the computers (may be possible with DNS I haven't gotten that far)

<b>USAGE</b>
- Install sendFile.lua to wherever you keep your programs (I keep mine in my root directory)
- Install and optionally rename 02_receiveFileDaemon.lua to your /startup/ folder
- Run sendFile.lua with 2 args (filename.lua, target computer ID)
